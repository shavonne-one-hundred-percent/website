On March 1, 2011, a 21-year-old young woman named Shavonne O'Loughlin was broad-sided on the driver's side in Los Angeles in front of Fairfax High School by a large SUV going 50 MPH in a 25 MPH school zone on Melrose Avenue. Shavonne was unsuspectingly on her way to work on the set of Gordon Ramsay's, "Master Chef", and the SUV never even braked.

Shavonne sustained massive injuries, included severe brain trauma and a broken left femur, hip, and pelvis, six cracked ribs, and a cracked C2 vertebrae.

**On March 3, 2011, Shavonne underwent a surgery to stabilize her broken femur:**

On March 5, 2011, the fifth day after the accident, Shavonne's brain swelled to the point at which it was necessary for the neurosurgeons to remove a large portion of her skull (which was implanted in her abdomen to be kept alive by her body for the next few months) so that her brain could swell under the remaining layer of skin without ending her life.

Shavonne went through many stages of waking up from her coma. At one point, she was completely unconsciousness but her eyes were partially open and would flicker wildly around the room, although not in response to stimuli. Later, she was seemingly awake, but she lacked any self-awareness and today retains zero memories of the several months that she spent in the hospital.
